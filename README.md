# U.S. Opioid Crisis Analysis

End-to-end data science project analyzing opioid prescribing trends, overdose mortality, and opioid use disorder (OUD) economic burden across U.S. states.

## Why this project matters

- Integrates multiple federal public health datasets into one modeling workflow.
- Combines statistical analysis with machine learning for policy-relevant insights.
- Produces transparent artifacts in both notebook and plain Python script formats.

## Project highlights

- Cleaned and harmonized CMS, CDC, and SAMHSA-related datasets.
- Built clustering and classification workflows (K-Means, hierarchical clustering, decision trees, SVM).
- Evaluated relationships between cost components and overdose burden.
- Identified strong regional and drug-type patterns, including fentanyl dominance.

## Selected results

- National opioid prescribing rates show a sustained decline from 2013 onward.
- A decision tree model classified provider credential groups at approximately 76% accuracy.
- Regional/drug clustering consistently isolates fentanyl-heavy overdose profiles.
- Cost-based SVM experiments reached up to 100% test accuracy when separating high-fatality state profiles.
- Criminal justice and productivity cost components show strong association with OUD burden in linear modeling.

## Role-fit summary

- Internship-ready: demonstrates strong fundamentals in data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and supervised/unsupervised modeling with clear communication of findings.
- Full-time-ready: demonstrates multi-source data integration, reproducible analysis workflow design, and translation of model outputs into policy-relevant insights.

## Reproducible setup

### 1) Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2) Install dependencies

```bash
make setup
```

or:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) Regenerate Python scripts from notebooks

```bash
make export-scripts
```

### 4) Validate script syntax

```bash
make validate-scripts
```

## Notes for reviewers/recruiters

- Start with the `scripts/` folder for a fast technical review of the full pipeline.
- Use `notebooks/` for methodology rationale, intermediate checks, and visual storytelling.
- This analysis uses aggregate state-level data and is intended to support (not replace) public health decision-making.
